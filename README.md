# Yaniv Scorecard

Welcome to my Yaniv Scorecard project! I designed this tool to simplify tracking scores for the card game Yaniv, allowing players to focus on the fun rather than the maths.

## About The Project

Yaniv is a card game played with a standard deck of cards, including 2 jokers. Itâ€™s a game of strategy and luck, and keeping track of scores manually can sometimes be cumbersome. I created this tool to streamline score-keeping, making it easier to focus on the game itself. Detailed instructions on how to play Yaniv are included in the project files and are also available online.

## Features

- **Record Scores**: Track the scores of up to 8 players, showing only the number of scorecards needed.
- **Custom Player Names**: Personalise the scorecards with custom names for each player.
- **Score Reduction Rule**: Automatically apply the rule to halve a player's score when they reach exactly 100 points.
- **Asaf Rule**: Implement the Asaf rule with a button to increment a player's score by 25 points.
- **Bust Detection**: Automatically record when a player is 'bust'.
- **Winner Declaration**: The scorecard will automatically declare a winner based on the current scores.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core programming language.
- **React**: Framework for building native apps using React.
- **Tailwind**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

## Usage

1. **Download or Clone**: Obtain the scorecard from this repository.
2. **Setup**: Open the scorecard tool and input the names of the players.
3. **Track Scores**: Update scores as the game progresses. The tool will handle score reductions, busts, and determine the winner for you.
4. **Enjoy**: Focus on the strategy and fun of Yaniv while the scorecard takes care of the numbers!
